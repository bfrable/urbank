# urbank

Sense this code challenge require no libraries or frameworks, I used nunjucks for templating, vanilla JS, and scss.

The development can be seen in the app directory and production is obviously in the dist directory. I parsed the JSON inside the gulpfile in case you were curious where that was being handled. 

I realize and understand that this project is not pixel perfect in comparison to the PSD. I moved last Friday, and accepted the project Sunday. I underestimated the time I would have with unpacking and everything that goes along with moving. I started this yesterday as you can see in the commit history, but it was also due yesterday at 5. I figured it be best to show my strengths and get this to you guys as soon as possible. In normal circumstances I do make the effort to match the design as close as possible as I do also have a background in UX design.

There are also some things I would have done differently but due to time contrainst I referenced those areas with comments acknowledging I was aware there is a better way to do it.

I enjoyed the project and appreciate the opportunity.
